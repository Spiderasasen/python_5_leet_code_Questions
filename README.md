# python_5_leet_code_Questions
this is where we will write the code to create the code to make the make a system if the examples that are given by leet code, we will also answer these . 2 easy questions, 2 medium question, and 1 hard question. we will answer the question as well.

# 2 Easy Questions
There are 2 questions that are categorized as easy difficulty in leet code that we are going to program here

[//]: # (roman integer)
1. Roman Integer
   1. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

            Symbol       Value

            I             1

            V             5

            X             10

            L             50

            C             100

            D             500
        
            M             1000

        For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II. 
        <br>
        Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

            I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 

            X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 

            C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

        Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

[//]: # (Largest Common Prefix)
2. Largest Common Prefix
    1. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

        If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

# Medium Questions
Here are going to be 2 questions that are ranked as Medium Difficulty in Leet Code

[//]: # (Add 2 Numbers)
1. Longest Palindromic Substring
   1. Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
[//]: # (Longest Substring without Reapting Characthers)
2. Longest Substring without Reacting Characters
   1. Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

[//]: # (Hard problem)
# Hard Problem
This question is ranked as difficult in Leet Code 

<em>May the Gods Help me</em>
1. Median of 2 Sorted Arrays
   1. Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

        The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
